# Jenkins
Jenkins- Groovy scripts

I have been working as devops engineer and found several simple and yet unique problems which seems not so benificial in the beginning but when used in Jenkins pipeline it gives upper hand and helps to counter problems and enhances the pipeline.

1. Merge Conflict Check :- https://github.com/Aniket7250/Jenkins/blob/develop/Merge%20Conflict%20Check
   Merge conflict check will check your code  merge between your git clone branch  and master branch.
    step1) clone branch,
    step2)  Check merge conflict
            step 1) Create a new merge,
            step 2) found git difference,
            step 3) abort git.
